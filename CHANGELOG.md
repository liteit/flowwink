## [Unreleased]

## [3.0.0] - 2026-07-19

The "agent-operated business" release. Since 1.3.0 the platform has completed the
turn from AI-assisted CMS to a Business Operating System run by agents — internal
(FlowPilot) and external (any MCP operator) — with the safety architecture to match:
identity-scoped customer self-service, evidence-bound autonomy, and a hardened fleet.
(Version note: this release supersedes both the stale `v2.0.0` git tag from the
early CMS era and the 1.x changelog line — the two numbering tracks merge here.)

### Added

**Identity ladder — customers talk to the business, safely**
- Customer portal assistant (`/account/assistant`): signed-in customers get an
  AI assistant scoped to their OWN account (rung 2) — orders, invoices, returns —
  with identity server-injected from the verified JWT, never from a body claim.
- Customer-scoped self-service returns: `request_return` resolves the order only
  among the caller's own orders; ownership enforced by construction.
- **B2B company scope (rung 3)**: `company_contacts` membership table, server-injected
  company identity, and eight company-scoped skills — reads (orders, invoices),
  writes (`request_company_return`, `reorder_company_order`, `request_company_quote`),
  commitment (`approve_company_quote`) and admin (`manage_company_contacts` with
  invite-on-signup) — role-gated viewer < buyer < approver < admin, enforced in the
  handler. Cross-company isolation proven adversarially: a contact of company A can
  never see or act on company B's data. Staff "Company Contacts" admin surface included.
- Pay-your-own-invoice via the payment rail: the assistant resolves the company's
  invoice and hands out the secure payment page — it never moves money.
- Company context dial: the assistant sees the active company's open items alongside
  the personal account, with explicit disambiguation between the two.

**FlowPilot 2.0 — the Hermes arc**
- Follow-through: staged and multi-step operations are resumed, not forgotten
  (`flowpilot-followthrough` sweep).
- Pipeline-collapse composites for chained flows, with dial inheritance — a composite
  never bypasses a stricter inner-skill gate.
- Skill Curator learning loop: evidence-driven proposals that improve skill
  instructions over time.
- Cost dials: heartbeat cadence and reasoning tier are per-instance configuration.
- **Evidence-bound objectives**: progress notes are stamped with machine-derived
  evidence (real skill outcomes from the activity log), and an objective can only be
  completed when its plan's work is actually evidenced — the agent's say-so is not proof.

**Agentic accounting (BR1)**
- Bank ingest → `propose_bookkeeping` → human review queue ("Händelser att bokföra"):
  the agent proposes, staged postings await approval, money never moves on its own.
- Opening balances (IB) management and Swedish VAT return preparation
  (SKV 4700 box mapping) via `prepare_vat_return`.

**Platform & operations**
- Outward MCP gateway connection profiles: `?groups=` specialist surfaces and
  `?mode=dispatch` (2-tool `search_skills`/`execute_skill`) for external operators,
  plus the `/rest/*` compatibility layer with distributed locking.
- Skill Relevance Engine as a platform primitive (shared by FlowPilot and the
  gateway), with IDF-weighted name matching.
- Self-hosted distribution: prebuilt multi-arch frontend image on ghcr
  (`flowwink-frontend`), Easypanel-ready. **Releases now publish pinnable
  `:vX.Y.Z` and `:stable` image tags; `:dev` remains bleeding edge.**
- Edge-function tier model (core vs optional) with core-verify, and the align-down
  rule: the skill surface always mirrors what is actually deployed per instance.
- Observability: `cron_health_report` makes silent scheduled-job failures loud;
  pg_net response codes as the source of truth for cron health.

### Fixed
- Automation cron parser: monthly expressions (`0 5 1 * *`) no longer silently fall
  back to hourly runs; weekday ranges (`1-5`) no longer run Mondays-only; the
  unsupported-expression fallback now logs.
- `newsletter-dispatch-scheduled` self-references its own instance (was hardcoded
  to the dev project fleet-wide); `publish-scheduled-pages` calls the DB function
  directly instead of a nonexistent edge function.
- Automation executor semantics (`flowpilot` executor requires the module on) and
  the `isModuleEnabled` site-settings gate.
- `prepare_vat_return` declares its period as required (`anyOf` in the tool schema)
  so agents pass it correctly.
- Visitor-intent lead trigger self-heals to its own instance.

### Security
- Fleet hardening sweep: RLS on all tables, `SECURITY DEFINER` functions pinned
  with `search_path`, the `agent_automations` permissive-UPDATE control-plane hole
  closed, service-role guards for agent-callable admin functions.
- Trust architecture: staged operations (`approve_pending_operation` handshake),
  per-skill trust levels that survive resyncs, and role/scope gates enforced
  server-side — never by the model.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added
- **Demo Data Platform**: Safe module reset & simulation data seeding (`seed_module_demo`, `reset_module_data`) with `demo_runs`/`demo_run_items` tracking

- **Platform Tests**: Unified `/admin/platform-tests` replacing smoke tests with module-aware suites, CI guardrails, and instance health dashboard
- **User Role Guardrails**: Automated test suite preventing role assignment regressions in `handle_new_user` trigger and edge functions
- **Demo Mode**: Toggle in `/admin/settings/general` controlling hourly `demo-cycle` reset job; demo login banner on auth page

- **Expense Procure-to-Pay Loop**: Full lifecycle (draft→submitted→approved→booked→paid) with BAS 2024 defaults
- **OCR Bank Statement Import**: Vision-based preview→commit flow via `reconciliation-import-image` edge function
- **POS v2 (Odoo-style)**: Barcode support, split tender payments, session-based batch journal on close
- **Stock Event Listener**: Automatic inventory movement on POS sales via `stock.movement` platform events
- **Invoice-driven Subscriptions**: Manual subscription billing with daily cron invoice generation

- **Timesheet Period Lock**: Accounting period close also locks time entries
- **HR Vacation Auto-Allocation**: Yearly vacation day allocation with audit logging
- **Unsplash Config Hint**: Admin alert when image API key is missing during block editing
- **Integration Status Truth**: `resolveIntegrationStatus` single source of truth; backend verification errors surfaced in UI

### Changed
- **Removed Clawable module**: Simplified architecture — single FlowWink instance, no multi-agent chat surface
- **Federation cleanup**: Reduced operator missions to 5 core categories aligned with external-agent-as-operator pivot
- **Smoke tests**: Skip disabled modules instead of false failures
- **Database migrations**: Consolidated baseline for cleaner fresh installs
- **Trust levels**: Outbound communication skills now require `approve` instead of `auto`

### Fixed
- **check-secrets edge function**: 403 errors for multi-role users resolved by explicit `admin` role filtering
- **handle_new_user trigger**: No longer assigns redundant `writer` role when `signup_type: "admin"` is specified
- **Demo template**: Fixed demo email credential display (`demo@flowwink.com`)
- **Fresh install UX**: Default modules disabled by default (opt-in); fewer confusing empty states
- **Edge function timeouts**: Fire-and-forget pattern for long-running operations bypassing 60s limits
- **CI**: `skill-linter` exits gracefully without DB URL on GitHub Actions
